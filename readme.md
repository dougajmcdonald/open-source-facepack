# Open Source Facepack

This is a the open-source-facepack for Football Manager 2019.

# Vision

Football Manager 2019 (and other versions) don't come with photos for all (many) of the players, especially those less well known.

You can download a facepack to make your FM2019 experience better by avoiding the silhouette and putting a real image in there.

This is an open source (anyone can contribute) facepack.

# Motivation

I found facepacks a pain to locate and once I found one it was tricky to find a mirror. Not having yet updated the pack I downloaded yet, I imagine it's a manual process of again finding the right link, finding a mirror, downloading and manually extracting the content into the right location.

This is an open source facepack which builds on the work of the DF11 team, allowing you to fill in blanks and update things easily.

Hopefully for anyone who knows how to use `git` this is an easier solution.

# Installation

## Pre-reqs

- Git
- Football manager

## Getting the faces

Clone the repository into your Football Manager 2019 `graphics` folder, for windows users it will be something like:

`C:\Users\<Your Username>\Documents\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2019\graphics`

If you're unfamiliar with `git`, open the command prompt/terminal, change to the folder above and run:

`git clone https://github.com/dougajmcdonald/open-source-facepack.git`

This will download all the face images.

# Contrubuting

If you want to add a face, make a pull request for the image you want to add / update, the filename must match the `player id` you wish to update.

## How to find the player id

//TODO I don't know how to do this!
